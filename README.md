# smogApp
Smog App Project for Java laboratories. Probably will be modified in near future. I'm planning to add GUI or maybe even rewrite it to another programming language. For now, it provides functions such as:
- displaying Air Quality Index for given measurement station
- displaying selected parameter value at given station at specified time
- displaying selected parameter average value in given time period at given station

...and many others. All app functionalities can be listed and explained by running program without any arguments. App uses JSON data format and GSON API aquired from gios.gov.pl
